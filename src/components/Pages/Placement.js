  <p class="lead-main">1) Aptitude</p>

  <p>

  The placement session for any company generally has 3 – 4 rounds. The first round is the written test, consisting of quantitative aptitude, reasoning (logical ability), English (verbal ability) and computer science subjects (C, C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, DBMS, OS, Networks, etc.).
For some companies, you might also have a coding round, which is sometimes taken as a separate round and sometimes is clubbed with the written test.
Further rounds are interview rounds, the first two usually being the technical round and successive rounds being the HR round.

  <p class="lead-main">2) Programming Language</p>

<p>
 It is recommended to know at least one language thoroughly, C++, Java, Python. Most commonly used languages are C++ and Java as some companies won’t allow you to code in Python as they have in-built libraries.C++ is the fastest language and is most commonly used for CP( Competitive Programming ) and Java & Python are used for CP as well as development.

  <p class="lead-main">3) Data structures and algorithms</p>

  <p>
  Data structure and algorithms are two of the most important aspects of computer science. Data structures allow us to organize and store data, while algorithms allow us to process that data in a meaningful way. Learning data structure and algorithms will help you become a better programmer.

  Data structures and algorithms are crucial for landing a job since they make it easier to handle programming-related issues and speed up the campus placement process. If a potential employer learns that you are an expert in data structures and algorithms, they will undoubtedly hire you because employers are constantly seeking out candidates with this skill set.
